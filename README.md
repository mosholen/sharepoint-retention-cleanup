# SharePoint Retention Cleanup ‚Äì Automated Document Library Cleanup
Automated cleanup script for SharePoint Online document libraries where Microsoft Purview retention auto-delete cannot run due to search exclusion. Recursively scans folders, deletes files older than a given threshold, and removes empty folders using Microsoft Graph API


This project is a **C# CLI tool** that uses the **Microsoft Graph API** to delete files and folders in a SharePoint Online document library based on file age.  
It was built specifically for scenarios where **Microsoft Purview Retention** auto-delete cannot run due to search exclusion, or where you want to manually trigger cleanup.

You can set this up as a schedule task to run it.

## üéØ Why this script was created
This tool was made to address a known limitation with **Microsoft Purview Retention** when a SharePoint site is excluded from search:

> Purview retention (auto-labels/auto-delete based on KQL/adaptive scope) relies on the search index to find content.  
> If a SharePoint site is set to *‚ÄúDo not allow this site to appear in search results‚Äù*, such auto-rules will not work.  
> You must either scope the policy **statically** (explicit URL/location) or use a cleanup script like this.

This tool is designed for exactly such cases ‚Äì when automated deletion won‚Äôt run because the site is excluded from search, or when you want to run a controlled cleanup.
